Polymorphism:
polymorphism allow us to perform same action in different ways.
Two type of polymorphism:
early binding compile(with the method overloading) and time runtime or late binding
(with the help of method overriding)

Final Keyword: usage of final keyword.

1) when we use it with the variable you can change the value of it.
2) when we create constant then we declare the variable as final.
3) we we us it with the class no other class can inherit from that class

Abstraction: is the process of hidden implementation details and only show the functionality to
the user.
Why we should use the abstraction:
  1) it reduces the code complexity.
  2) it allow the user to focus on using the feature no.t implementation
Syntax:
  we need to declare the method as a abstract that we don't want implementation.
