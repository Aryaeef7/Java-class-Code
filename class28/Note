Collection framework:
  A collection of class and interfaces which help us store and mange objects in the
  form of collection. for example # arraylist # LinkList these classes make it easier
  to manage the data as they have ready made-method that we use.

Wrapper Classes;
we can use primitive data type as abject with the help of wrapper classes. we want to de
  it because primitive data types are not supported by the classes in collection framework
like Arraylist.

Boxing:
 is the process of converting primitive data types to its corresponding wrapper type or
 object type. ex.
 int number = integer; // it is auto unboxing
  int number2 = integer.intValue();// unboxing
 AutoBoxing
 it says that we just have to assign a wrapper type of variable and conversion
 will happen auto.  ex.
 Character gf='a'; => Autoboxing
 char ch = gf; => Auto unboxing

 Arraylist:
 Arraylist is o apart of collections framework. we  can store single object inside
 array list it work very similar how array works but it is dynamic in nature
automatically unlike we don't provide the size upfront.

Diamond Operator;
 are also called angle bracket '<>'. they used to specify the name of the class
 who object we will be storing inside the classes which belong to the collections
 framework or any other class which uses java generics.
ArrayList vs LinkedList:
if in your code use get method and you don't add or remove elements from in bettwen
then you should always us ArrayList.
if most of the time you add or remove
