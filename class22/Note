MethodOverloading:
  its a mechanism in java that allow us to have same method name with
  different parameter.
  parameter can be different in number, type or sequence.
Why we should overload a method?
  1) Method overloading allow us to re use same method name a gian and a gian
  2) it allows us to write clean code.
How to overload a method:
we can overload a method by redefining  it with different parameter.

Method Overriding:
  it is a mechanism  in java that allow a subclass or child class to provide a
  specific implementation of a method.
Why we should override a method?
  if a child class does not like the implementation of the parent class
  it has the flexibility that it can override that method.

Rule:
  1) to override the method there must be parent child relationship between classes.
  2) if something  can't be inherited we can not override it. for example private method
  and constructors
  3) visibility of a method can be increase for example if something has
   default access.
