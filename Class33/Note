Exceptions:
  is an unwanted behavior that occurs at run time and make our program
  terminate abruptly ,
Exception Handling:
  is a mechanism that allow us the runtime errors and help us convert complex error.
  messages to something simpler that a normal user can understand.
How do we implement exception handling in Java:
we have new keyword words and new blocks of code which allow us to handle exc..
  1) try 2) catch 3)finally keywords 4) throw 5) throws

Try Block:
  in the try block we write the code which may throw an exception.
Catch Block:
  contain the backup code , the code that we want to execute in case of failure.
  it can also contain code to simplify the error messages it can also contain the code
  which might send a notification or an email to the developer or admins in case
  of failure.
How it work:
   we can have multiple catch block. each handle a different  error
   we can also put a last block with Exception class so that if something goes
   wrong and there is no specific catch block to handle it the Exception one will
   handle it

Finally block;
  is always execute no matter what happens in the try block or the catch block.
  we should put cleanup code inside the finally block like closing a browser closing
  database connection etc.
