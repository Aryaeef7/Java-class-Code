Abstraction:
allow us to simplify code by hiding implementation details only showing functionality
to the user. in  java we can achieve this nin two ways.
1) Abstract classes 2) Interface
Interface-is very similar to a abstract class, we can have private methods static method
default methods,   we cant have instance fields in an interface.
and also can't have constructor in interface.
Why we should learn about interface:
 when object..
