Set:
  Set: do not allow duplicate value. there are three type of set
  1)HshSet 2)LinkedHahSet 3)TreeSet
HashSet:
Upside: it is the fastest speed
DownSide: it does not maintain the insertion
LinkedHashSet:
 Upside: maintain the insertion order
 DownSide:slower then HashSet
TreeSet:
  Upside: keeps the data sorted
  Downside: it is slower then all

Map:
 Maps allow us to store data in the form of Key value pairs. just like sets we have
 three    main type of maps as well. 1)HashMap 2)LinkedHashMap 3) TreeMap

 HashMap:
 Upside: it is the fastest speed
 DownSide: it does not maintain the insertion
 LinkedHashMap:
  Upside: maintain the insertion order
  DownSide:slower then HashSet
 TreeMap:
   Upside: keeps the data sorted
   Downside: it is slower then all
