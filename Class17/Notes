 these modifiers are control the accessibility of instance or static field,
 methods and classes.there are four access levels and there are three access
 modifier keywords.
 1) Private 2) default 3) protected 4)public
Constructors help us create object easily or initialize the instance field of
class in a better way.
Rules:
1) They aren similar nto the method, but they don't have return.
2) They have same name as class name.
3) we can use all the access modifiers with the constructors.
4) static keyword is not allowed
